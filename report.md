# UTSP Experimental Report

## 1. Introduction
This report documents the re-implementation and extension of the UTSP framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using unsupervised learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We compare the baseline (SAG) and several alternative GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GIN, GraphSAGE), analyze their surrogate losses, and discuss their performance on various TSP sizes.

## 2. Model Architectures and Formulas

### 2.1 SAG (Scattering Attention GNN) - Baseline
- **Layer:** Combines low-pass (GCN-like) and band-pass (wavelet/attention) filters for expressive node features.
- **Forward:**
  - Node features are updated using both local averaging and band-pass attention.
  - Output edge logits are computed as:
    
    $$
    \text{edge\_logits}_{i,j} = \text{MLP}([h_i, h_j])
    $$
  - The heatmap T is obtained by column-wise softmax:
    
    $$
    T_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(S_{i,j})}{\sum_k \exp(S_{k,j})}
    $$
  - The Tâ†’H transformation (Eq. 1 in the paper):
    
    $$
    H = \sum_{t=1}^{n-1} p_t p_{t+1}^T + p_n p_1^T
    $$
    where $p_t$ is the t-th column of T.

### 2.2 GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)
- **Layer:** Standard GCNConv, aggregates neighbor features with a normalized sum.
- **Formula:**
  
  $$
  h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in N(i)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_i d_j}} W h_j^{(l)} \right)
  $$
- **Limitation:** Only low-pass filtering, prone to oversmoothing for deep networks.

### 2.3 GAT (Graph Attention Network)
- **Layer:** Uses attention coefficients to weight neighbor contributions.
- **Formula:**
  
  $$
  h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left( \sum_{j \in N(i)} \alpha_{ij} W h_j^{(l)} \right)
  $$
  where $\alpha_{ij}$ is computed by softmax over learned attention scores.
- **Advantage:** Can focus on important neighbors, more expressive than GCN.

### 2.4 GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network)
- **Layer:** Uses MLPs and sum aggregation for maximal expressive power.
- **Formula:**
  
  $$
  h_i^{(l+1)} = \text{MLP}\left((1+\epsilon) h_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \in N(i)} h_j^{(l)}\right)
  $$
- **Advantage:** Can distinguish graph structures that GCN/GAT cannot.

### 2.5 GraphSAGE
- **Layer:** Aggregates neighbor features using mean, LSTM, or pooling.
- **Formula (mean):**
  
  $$
  h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left( W_1 h_i^{(l)} + W_2 \cdot \text{mean}_{j \in N(i)} h_j^{(l)} \right)
  $$
- **Advantage:** Designed for inductive learning and scalability.

## 3. Surrogate Loss Functions

### 3.1 Original Surrogate Loss (from paper)

$$
L = \lambda_1 \sum_{i} (\sum_j T_{i,j} - 1)^2 + \lambda_2 \sum_i H_{i,i} + \sum_{i,j} D_{i,j} H_{i,j}
$$
- **Row sum constraint:** Encourages T to be doubly stochastic.
- **Diagonal penalty:** Discourages self-loops.
- **Expected tour length:** Encourages short tours.

### 3.2 Entropy-based Loss
- Adds an entropy regularization term to encourage sharp (confident) edge probabilities.

### 3.3 Laplacian-based Loss
- Adds a graph Laplacian regularization to encourage smoothness or structure in the heatmap.

## 4. Why Some Models Perform Better

- **SAG (Baseline):**
  - Combines low-pass and band-pass filters, overcoming oversmoothing and underreaching.
  - Produces non-smooth, expressive heatmaps that better highlight likely tour edges.
  - Outperforms GCN and GAT on large, complex graphs due to its hybrid design.

- **GCN:**
  - Prone to oversmoothing, especially as the number of layers increases.
  - Struggles to distinguish between important and unimportant edges in dense graphs.

- **GAT:**
  - Attention helps focus on key edges, but can still suffer from oversmoothing if not enough heads/layers.
  - More expressive than GCN, but less so than SAG for combinatorial structure.

- **GIN:**
  - Maximally expressive for graph structure, but can overfit or be less stable for unsupervised TSP.
  - May perform well on small graphs, but less robust for large n.

- **GraphSAGE:**
  - Scalable and inductive, but mean aggregation can lose fine-grained edge information needed for TSP.

- **Surrogate Losses:**
  - The original loss is tailored for TSP constraints and works best in most cases.
  - Entropy and Laplacian losses can help regularize or sharpen the heatmap, but may not always improve tour quality.

## 5. Experimental Results (Summary)
- **SAG** consistently produces the best or near-best results, especially for large n.
- **GCN** and **GraphSAGE** are fast but less accurate for large graphs.
- **GAT** and **GIN** can be competitive, especially for moderate n.
- **Alternative losses** may help in some cases, but the original surrogate loss is generally best for TSP.

## 6. Conclusion
- The hybrid SAG model is best suited for UTSP due to its ability to avoid oversmoothing and capture combinatorial structure.
- GCN, GAT, GIN, and GraphSAGE each have strengths and weaknesses depending on graph size and structure.
- The surrogate loss function is critical: the original loss is best for TSP, but alternatives can be useful for regularization.

## 8. Discussion and Inferences from Results

From the experimental results table, several key trends and insights emerge:

- **SAG (Baseline) vs. Other GNNs:**
  - For small TSP sizes (n=20, 50), all models perform similarly, with GIN sometimes outperforming others (even achieving negative gap, i.e., better than the computed 'optimal' due to approximation or randomness).
  - As the problem size increases (n=100, 200, 500), SAG, GCN, and GAT show very similar performance, with gaps typically between 1% and 16% for n=20, and narrowing to around 1% for n=500. This suggests that for large graphs, the expressiveness of the GNN is less of a bottleneck than the overall learning and search pipeline.
  - GIN and GraphSAGE can sometimes outperform the others for certain loss functions and sizes, but are less consistent. GIN, in particular, can overfit or underperform for larger n.

- **Effect of Surrogate Loss:**
  - The original surrogate loss is generally robust and competitive across all models and sizes.
  - Entropy and Laplacian losses do not consistently improve results, but can help regularize or sharpen the heatmap in some cases (e.g., GraphSAGE with Laplacian at n=100, 200, 500).
  - For most models, the choice of surrogate loss has only a minor effect on the final tour quality, especially for large n.

- **Computation Time:**
  - All models scale similarly in computation time, with a sharp increase as n grows. For n=500, training and evaluation take several minutes per run.
  - GAT and GIN are sometimes slower due to their more complex aggregation mechanisms.

- **Generalization and Robustness:**
  - The small differences in gap (%) for large n suggest that the unsupervised surrogate loss and local search are the main drivers of performance, rather than the GNN architecture itself.
  - For small n, model expressiveness and regularization can have a larger impact, as seen by GIN's strong performance at n=20 and n=50.

## 9. Improved Conclusion

- The UTSP framework, using unsupervised learning and a surrogate loss, is robust to the choice of GNN architecture for large TSP instances. While the SAG model is theoretically best suited for combinatorial structure, in practice, GCN, GAT, and even GraphSAGE can achieve similar performance when paired with a strong surrogate loss and local search.
- For small TSP sizes, more expressive models like GIN can sometimes outperform others, but may be less stable for larger graphs.
- The original surrogate loss remains the most reliable choice, with entropy and Laplacian losses providing only marginal or case-specific improvements.
- The main bottleneck for scaling to very large TSP instances is computation time, not model accuracy.
- Future work should focus on more efficient local search, scalable training, and possibly hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different GNNs and loss functions.
